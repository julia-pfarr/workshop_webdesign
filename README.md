## NOWA Workshop: Web-Design for Scientists

This is the git repo for the website on "Web-Design for Scientists: A workshop for easy and fast website generation using mkdocs."

#### Content 

More and more scientists make use of easy static website generation to introduce themselves and their work to the broad public, potential future employers or funding sources.

During the workshop we will set up our own website using [GitHub Pages], [MkDocs], and [Material for MkDocs].

After going through this workshop you'll have a first draft of your website and the skills to develop the website further on your own.
