##### Task 1

Deploy your website with GitHub Pages.

The developers of Material for Mkdocs wrote a very good documentation about how to deploy your website on GitHub. Thus, I won't add anything to this but redirect you to the section [Publishing your site] on their website. 

[Publishing your site]: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/
