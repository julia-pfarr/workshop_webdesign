During the workshop we will set up our own website using [Material for MkDocs] and [GitHub Pages].[^1]

After going through this workshop you'll have a first draft of your website and the skills to develop the website further on your own.

Take a look at  [Anna-Lena's website] that was created with this workshop for an example of what you can do!
