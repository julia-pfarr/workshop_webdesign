To actively participate in the workshop you should have...

1. ... [python] installed in order to use pip for installing the python package we need for setting up the website.<br><br>
When you have python installed, run the following command in your terminal in order to install "Material for mkdocs", which we will use to create our website:
```
pip install mkdocs-material
```
2. ... a [GitHub] account.
3. ... a local code editor, such as [VS Code]. I highly recommend VS Code because it provides you with... 
    - syntax highlighting for multiple languages (which we will need)
    - displaying multiple files next to each other (we will need to modify content in multiple files simultaneously)
    - preview for rendered markdown-files (which we will work with to design the content)
